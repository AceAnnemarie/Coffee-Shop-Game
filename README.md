## Features

- Simulate the preparation of coffee.
- Earn money based on the coffee served.
- Track total earnings.

## Requirements

To build and run the Coffee Shop Game, you need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++ or clang++).
- C++11 or later support for `std::this_thread::sleep_for` and `std::chrono`.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CoffeeShopGame.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd CoffeeShopGame
   ```

3. **Compile the Program**

   Use a C++ compiler like `g++` to build the executable:

   ```bash
   g++ -o CoffeeShopGame main.cpp
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Program**

   Execute the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./CoffeeShopGame
   ```

2. **Interact with the Game**

   - **1. Take an order**: The game will simulate a customer order and prompt you to prepare the coffee.
   - **2. Exit**: Exits the game and displays a thank you message.

   Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the game.

## How It Works

- **Coffee Types**: There are three types of coffee available: Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino.
- **Customer Orders**: Orders are simulated randomly. Each order will specify a type of coffee.
- **Preparation Time**: Coffee preparation is simulated with a 2-second delay.
- **Earnings**: You earn money based on the coffee served, and the total earnings are displayed after each order.
